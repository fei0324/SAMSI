# SAMSI Statistics Workshop Project
### Data Modeling on MS Patients' MRI Scan Results

#### Preview
During the week of SAMSI (The Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute) workshop at North Carolina State University, 5 students from different universities across the country formed a group to analyze a dataset of MS patient scans collected at Johns Hopkins University and the Kennedy-Krieger Institute. Our goal was to determine whether diffusion properties were related to cognitive ability and to predict what covariates MS diagnoses were dependent on. In order to achieve our goal, we explored and statistically compared cognitive and demographic factors between MS and Control patients.

#### Outline
1. Data partitioning
2. Understand PASAT (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) Scores
3. Model PASAT scores with multiple linear regressions (Simpliest Strategy)
4. Further analyze data in regards of its case and gender differences
5. Model Fitting (Poisson, Quasi-Poisson, fGAM, LASSO, Bayes FoSR)
6. Conclusions
